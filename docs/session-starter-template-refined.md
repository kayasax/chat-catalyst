*Project memory file for AI assistant session continuity. Auto-referenced by system prompt.*

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Context
**Project:** Chat Catalyst VS Code Extension  
**Type:** TypeScript VS Code Extension  
**Purpose:** Enhance AI chat interactions with intelligent context file attachments  
**Status:** âœ… Published to marketplace (v0.1.3)

**Core Technologies:**
- TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, Node.js File System
- Extension commands, workspace integration, file persistence

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State
**Build Status:** âœ… Fully functional and deployed  
**Key Achievement:** Fixed context file persistence (24h retention vs 30min)  
**Active Issue:** None - extension working as designed

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Smart context detection for long prompts (>1000 chars)
- Session_starter.md auto-attachment with priority over README.md
- Managed timer system for resource cleanup (24h file retention)
- Multiple workspace path detection (parent/subdirectory support)

---

## ðŸ§  Technical Memory

**Critical Discoveries:**
- Context file persistence bug was key blocker (fixed 2025-06-18)
- Workspace path detection needed multi-path fallback (fixed 2025-07-02)
- Session_starter.md requires absolute priority over other project files
- Extension works via Ctrl+Alt+C shortcut, not manual chat typing

**Performance Insights:**
- Files persist 24 hours for chat session continuity
- Smart cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Debug logging essential for workspace path troubleshooting

**Known Constraints:**
- Context files must be accessible via #file: references
- Session_starter.md detection requires multiple path checking
- Extension only activates on specific commands, not manual prompts
