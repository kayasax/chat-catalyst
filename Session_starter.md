## 🧠 Assistant Memory
This section is maintained by the AI assistant to track important context and decisions across sessions.

**Current Understanding:** ✅ **EXTENSION IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL!** The extension successfully detects long auto-prompts (>1000 characters) and creates persistent context files referenced via #file: syntax. Critical file persistence issue has been resolved - context files now persist for 24 hours instead of 30 minutes, ensuring #file: references remain valid throughout chat sessions.

**Known Constraints or Requirements:**
- ✅ Context files accessible via #file: references for entire chat session (FIXED)
- ✅ Files persist for 24 hours minimum (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ Extension handles Session_starter.md attachment when available (WORKING)
- ✅ Proper cleanup of resources and event listeners to prevent memory leaks (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ Smart context file creation in temp directory and .vscode/ for accessibility (WORKING)

**Recent Achievements:**
- Fixed critical context file persistence bug (24h vs 30min retention)
- Implemented managed timer system for proper resource cleanup
- Verified Session_starter.md auto-attachment functionality
- Confirmed #file: reference generation and accessibility
