**Universal Template Architecture**: Uses a single, comprehensive template with 11 strategic placeholders that adapt to any development scenario.

**Intelligent Defaults**: Analyzes your workspace for:
- File extensions and languages
- Package.json, requirements.txt, .csproj files
- Framework detection (React, .NET, Python packages, etc.)
- Workspace folder names and structure

**Session Memory**: Each workspace gets its own configuration, automatically loaded when you start chat sessions.

## 🛠️ Configuration

Access via VS Code Settings → Extensions → Chat Catalyst:

- **Enabled**: Toggle auto-injection on/off
- **Auto Prompt**: Legacy simple prompt (for backward compatibility)

Session primers are managed through the command palette for the best user experience.

## 🚀 Migration from Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from an earlier version:

1. Your existing auto-prompt settings are preserved
2. Use `Chat Catalyst: Edit Prompt (Legacy & Advanced)` to access old settings
3. We recommend switching to session primers for much better AI interactions

## 📈 Why Session Primers Work Better

Traditional prompts are static and generic. Session primers are:

- **Context-Aware**: Include project-specific information
- **Goal-Oriented**: Define what you want to accomplish
- **Style-Matched**: Respect your communication preferences
- **Experience-Appropriate**: Tailored to your skill level
- **Memory-Enhanced**: Maintain context across sessions
