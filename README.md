A simple VS Code extension that automatically adds your custom prompt to every new chat session.

## What it does

- No more retyping the same instructions every time
- Perfect for maintaining context between sessions

## Popular use case

Set your prompt to maintain project context and memory between sessions:

```
Please check if Session_starter.md exists in the workspace. If it exists, read it thoroughly to understand the current project context, progress, and our previous discussions. If it doesn't exist, ask me a few questions about the project (goals, current state, tech stack, challenges) and then create the file to track our progress. Throughout our conversation, regularly update the file with key findings, decisions, and progress made. This helps maintain continuity between sessions.
