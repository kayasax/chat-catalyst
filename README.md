## 🔥 **Popular Prompts That Will Change Your Life**

### 🧠 **The Project Memory Prompt** (Most Popular!)
```
Step 1: Load Project Context
Check if session_starter.md exists in the workspace. If it exists: Read and use it to understand the project's goals, constraints, and current status. If it does not exist: Ask me a few questions to gather the necessary context, then create the file with a summary of our discussion.

Step 2: Maintain Persistent Memory
Use the context file as your memory across sessions. Update it regularly with key findings, decisions, blockers, and progress. Use it to maintain continuity and avoid repeating questions or work.

Step 3: Behavior Expectations
Be proactive: suggest next steps, improvements, or missing pieces. Be concise and structured in your responses. When unsure, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
```
*Turns your AI into a project memory system that never forgets! 🤯*
